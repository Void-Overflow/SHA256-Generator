# SHA256-Generator
Comyar D/Void-Overflow

Welcome to SHA256 Generator!
This is a pretty basic application used for making SHA256 Hashes.
Now you may be asking, what do we provide that others don't, well for starters
we have a file that logs every hash you have created so you don't lose it.
We also do NOT keep track of what hashes our user make. We understand privacy is 
sacred and we do NOT take advantage of that.

To use it, please open the .exe file in the folder from where you downloaded it. Using it should
be pretty straight forward. Every hash you make is loged. To find the logged hashes, please open up the 
folder where SHA256 generator is located, and open the HashLog.txt file. Then from there, you can view your hashes. For personal help, please submit an issue on this repository.

Like I prevously said, it's a pretty straightforward software. We DO have rules. One huge one is REDISTRIBUTION OF THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT ALLOWED, and WE DO NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABLITY FOR WHAT IS DONE WITH THIS SOFTWARE! For more rules, please read the TOS.txt file lovated in your SHA256 folder. Other than that, feel free to hash away! 

This software is managed and owned by
